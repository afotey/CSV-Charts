**Available in M Chart v.1.1+**

M Chart has implemented a Shortcake Shortcode UI.

[Shortcake](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/) provides a method for creating interfaces that allow authors to embed and use shortcodes from the edit panel of a post without writing the shortcakes themselves.  It also quite nicely renders those shortcodes inside the edit panel of the post when in the **Visual** tab of the post content field.

Here's how to use it:

1. From the edit panel of a post click on the **Add Media** button
2. Click on **Insert Post Element**
3. Choose **Charts**
4. Click on the **Search** input
5. Type some keywords that match the chart you are looking for
6. Choose the chart you want from the drop down
7. Click on the **Insert Element** button
8. Checkout the cool rendered version of the chart showing up in the **Visual** tab of the post content field.
