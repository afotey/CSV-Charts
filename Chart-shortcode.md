Once you've got a chart you want to use in a post make sure you've published it.  Then copy the Shortcode generated for you at the bottom of the chart settings (clicking on the field will automatically select the entire shortcode for you):

![Shortcode](https://methnen.com/misc/m-chart/shortcode.png)

You'll notice an Image field and View button to the right of the Shortcode field. Every time you update your chart post a high resolution PNG copy will be generated as well.

The shortcode is smart enough that it will use the image version in situations where the Javascript version will not work. The best example of that is in your RSS or Atom feeds.

The copied shortcode can then be pasted into your other post types:

![Hello world](https://methnen.com/misc/m-chart/hello-world.png)

Then wherever the shortcode was placed you get a nicely rendered Chart on the front end:

![Hello world front end](https://methnen.com/misc/m-chart/hello-world-front-end.png)

And it even works well on mobile:
